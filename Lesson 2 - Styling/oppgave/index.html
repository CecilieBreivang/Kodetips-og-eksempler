      <h2 id="water">Water might not be wet</h2>
      <p>
        This is because most scientists define wetness as a liquid´s ability to
        maintain contact with a solid surface, meaning that water itself is not
        wet, but can make other objects wet.

      <h2 id="snails">Snails have teeth</h2>
      <p>
        Between 1,000 and 12,000 teeth, to be precise. They aren’t like ours,
        though, so don’t be thinking about snails with ridiculous toothy grins.
        You’ll find the snail's tiny 'teeth' all over its file-like tongue.

      <h2 id="allergic">Animals can be allergic to humans</h2>
      <p>
        Animals can be allergic to our dead skin cells – dander. These allergic
        reactions can be just like ours, too, including breathing difficulties
        and skin irritation.
